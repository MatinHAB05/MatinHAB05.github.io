This is a friend's project that I tried it.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/cov.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

</div>

<div class="caption">
      of course it is not complete yet...
</div>
