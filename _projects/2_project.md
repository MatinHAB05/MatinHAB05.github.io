This is an other project that I tried to simulate XO game.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/doooz.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

</div>

<div class="caption">
      it looks like a simple appearance, but it works well
</div>
